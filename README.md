timecode
========

Library for working with `Timecodes` (support drop frames for NTSC).
This library was designed for `AngularJS` but was rethinked and
now it is not coupled to any of frameworks. Also it can be slightly modified
with `UMD` to be used in `NodeJS` env.

## Tests:

`npm install`

`make test`

### Coverage

`make coverage`

### Brutal test

I have commented test that look over all possible timecodes and check if dropframes treated in proper maner. These tests are commented as they run about 30 seconds.

## Use:

`Timecode.parse(timecode, frameRate)`

`Timecode.format(frames, frameRate)`

`new Timecode(DateTimecode, frameRate)`

## Instance methods:

- `setTimecode(timecode)`
- `setFrames(frames)`
- `setDTC(DateTimecode)`

- `formatDate()` -- return date in format '2014-03-31'
- `formatTimecode()` -- return timecode in format '00:00:00;00'
- `format()` -- return DTC in format '2014-03-31 00:00:00;00'

- `add(timecode|frames)` - you can add some timecode or amount of frames to current DTC, timecode/frames can be negative
- `subtract(timecode|frames)` - the same as above but subtract frames

`add` and `subtract` methods shift date if time is over 23:59:59;29 or above 00:00:00;00
